# Meshtastic OSINT Tool

Designed by [Cyber-Hack Solutions LLC](https://cyberhacksolutions.com), this tool leverages APIs from:
- [MeshMap Nodes](https://meshmap.net/nodes.json)
- [Meshtastic Device Stats](https://meshtastic.liamcottle.net/api/v1/stats/hardware-models)

This tool gathers real-time node data from the above sources and displays it in a tabulated, terminal-friendly format. While you can visit [meshmap.net](https://meshmap.net) to view this information directly in a browser, this tool offers an alternative for structured data presentation and interaction from the terminal.

> **For educational purposes only**
